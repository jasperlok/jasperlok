During a stormy night, I decided that I need a change to my life, ie. going back to my "first love" - statistics. Jeng jeng jeng *just pretend this is the background sound effect and pretend there were heavy rain and lighting out there.


I wish things were so easy for me to decide. It took me more than 8 years to figure out and make a decision to go back to my "first love" - statistics. I was always very intriguing on how we could uncover the story hidden within the data. My first attempt of performing such task (ie. drawing insights from the data) was on a project to fit a generalised linear model on the probability of passengers surviving in such event.
